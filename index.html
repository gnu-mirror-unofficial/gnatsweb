<p>Gnatsweb is looking for a maintainer.  If you're interested, please
take a look at this <a href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general
information about GNU packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then
email maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and
interest. Thanks!</p>

<p>Please note that maintaining this package requires <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">assigning
copyright to the FSF</a>, and ensuring that any future contributors
also execute papers, since that is what past authors and contributors
have done.</p><hr>


<p>Gnats itself could also use development help or a co-maintainer.
Same applies.
